# 💄 Lipstick Index 2.0 — When Markets Whisper, Beauty Screams

They say numbers don’t lie. I say they don’t always tell the whole story.  
The *Lipstick Index* — coined during downturns when cosmetic sales surged — was once dismissed as a quirky anecdote.  
I rebuilt it for the modern economy, backed by **data, sentiment, and proof.**

This isn’t a hobby project. It’s an **economic signal reimagined**.  
It’s where **consumer behavior, social media trends, and financial markets collide** — and I turned it into insights you can’t ignore.

## 📊 The Core Play
- **Google Trends** — “lipstick,” “makeup,” “drugstore vs luxury brands.”  
- **Social Media Sentiment** — TikTok, Instagram, Reddit posts decoded with NLP.  
- **Beauty Stock Prices** — Estée Lauder, L’Oréal, Ulta, Revlon.  
- **Macro Data** — GDP growth, unemployment, consumer confidence.  

The question:  
*Can lipstick searches and beauty sentiment outsmart Wall Street’s models in predicting consumer confidence and stock performance?*

## 🔥 The Visual Evidence
Because in my world, you don’t just make claims — you *prove them.*  

📈 Lipstick searches vs GDP growth

💬 Social sentiment vs Beauty stock price

The pattern is clear:  
- When GDP dives, lipstick searches spike.  
- When sentiment falls, beauty stocks take the hit.  

Coincidence? I don’t buy coincidences.

## 🚀 The Workflow
1. **Data Engine** (`src/data_loader.py`) → Clean, structured datasets.  
2. **Sentiment Analyzer** (`src/sentiment_analysis.py`) → NLP turns chatter into metrics.  
3. **Visual Playbook** (`src/visualization.py`) → Trends meet storytelling.  
4. **Predictive Model** (`src/modeling.py`) → Regression linking lipstick buzz to market moves.  

Run it once, and the pipeline delivers **figures, metrics, and forecasts.**
